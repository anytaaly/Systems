<p> This project helped me revised all the C syntax which we have learnt in CIT593. </p>

<p> The most chllenging part for me was to read and understand the calls from man documentation. I am a visual peerson so I learnt better if someone could show me how to do it. but reading material is something I find difficult . But I am glad that I got this opportunity to read and learn. </p>

<h1> Mosst difficult bug </h1> 
<p> I had issues with heap clearance. I spend almost 1 hour trying to de allocate the malloc block, I learnt that I was malloc wuth NULLs only. </p>

<h1> Over all time spent on Project 1a</h1>
<p> I spent almost 9 hours al together for project 1a</p>
